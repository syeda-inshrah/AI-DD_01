### What does AI-Driven Development mean to you?

AI-Driven is a powerful thing for us. It is very beneficial for both beginners and experienced developers. For beginners, it is useful because they can easily learn any language through it in just a few days. For experienced developers, it is also very beneficial. For example, they won't have to write as much code, they will avoid errors, and they can focus on their main work, like creating the project structure and defining specifications. The rest of the work is for the AI-driven tool. So, this is very helpful for us.

### How do you see the future of Human–AI Collaboration in software development?

I see the future of human-AI collaboration where they will be very much in profit. Like, using AI, they can get their different tasks done in weeks or even days instead of years. And this thing is very good for them; they won't have to take much tension nor do much work. That's why collaborating with AI can benefit them immensely, and they can work with big companies.
